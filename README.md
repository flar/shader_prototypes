This package can help keep your Dart code up to date with the potential changes
in uniform slot indices that can happen when you edit a `.frag` file associated
with one or more of your FragmentProgram objects.

There is a manual step involved when you edit your `.frag` files, which is to
run the generate command below to update your Dart language shader prototype
files.

## Features

This package creates Dart classes to directly set the uniforms on your
FragmentShader objects when you run a generator command that allow you
to set the uniforms as fields, such as:

```dart
  myShader.uColor.color = Colors.red;
  myShader.uMix = 3.0;
  myShader.uPos.xy = Offset(10, 15);
```

where `uColor`, `uMix` and `uPos` are the names used in the `.frag` file
for uniforms of types `vec4`, `float`, `vec2` correspondingly.

## Getting started

To install this package in your Flutter project, add the following lines to the
dependencies section in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
  shader_prototypes:
    git: https://github.com/flar/shader_prototypes.git
```

Once you have your shaders created, invoke the prototype generator script from
the package using:

```shell
dart run shader_prototypes:generate_prototypes
```

That command will scan your `pubspec.yaml` file for the list of shaders you've
declared and create class prototypes for your shaders within your project
in the `lib/src/gen/shader_prototypes` subdirectory, or you can override this
location using the `--output-dir` option.

Once this script has done its work, you need to run it manually every time
you adjust the naming, ordering, or number of your uniforms in your `.frag`
files. You can run it every time you make any change to these files, but the
only changes that affect the script's output are changes to the uniforms.

As an example, if your shader looks like this:

```
#include <flutter/runtime_effect.glsl>

uniform vec4 uColor;
uniform float uScale;

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
  vec2 pos = FlutterFragCoord();

  fragColor = vec4(
    mod(uColor.r - pos.x * uScale, 1.0),
    mod(uColor.g - pos.y * uScale, 1.0),
    mod(uColor.b - (pos.x + pos.y) * uScale, 1.0),
    uColor.a
  );
}
```

the script will generate a class file that looks like this:

```dart
// THIS FILE IS GENERATED BY generate_prototypes.dart FROM shaders/my_shader.frag.
// DO NOT EDIT OR CHECK THIS INTO SOURCE CONTROL

import 'dart:ui';

import 'package:shader_prototypes/shader_prototypes.dart';

class MyShader {
  MyShader() {
    shader = _program!.fragmentShader();
    _uColor = UniformVec4(shader, 0);
  }

  late final FragmentShader shader;
  UniformVec4 get uColor => _uColor;
  set uScale(double value) => shader.setFloat(4, value);

  late final UniformVec4 _uColor;

  static FragmentProgram? _program;
  static Future<void> init() async {
    _program = await FragmentProgram.fromAsset('shaders/my_shader.frag');
  }
}
```

Which you can use in, for instance, a CustomPainter.paint method like this:

```dart
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final MyShader myShader = MyShader()
      ..uColor.color = color
      ..uScale = scale;

    Paint p = Paint()
      ..shader = myShader.shader;

    canvas.drawRect(Offset.zero & size, p);
  }
```
## Usage

```shell
A utility to generate Dart language class definitions from fragment shader source files.

Usage: dart run shader_prototypes:generate_prototypes [arguments]

Global options:
    --output-dir    Directory to write the shader class source files.
                    (defaults to "lib/src/gen/shader_prototypes")
-h, --[no-]help
```

## Additional information

This project is currently in a proof of concept stage and uses very simple text parsing
of the shaders to determine the offsets of the shader uniforms. Eventually it should use
the `impellerc` program to produce the uniform offsets in a more reliable way that would
also involve syntax checking the shader and be more resilient to syntax and line endings.
