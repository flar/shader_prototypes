# simple_shader

An example project to demonstrate the use of the shader_prototypes package.

The project contains a simple shader with a float and a vec4 uniform and source
for a Flutter app that uses the shader through an interface generated by the
shader_prototypes package.

lib/
  gen/
    shaders/
      my_shader.dart - the prototype generated by shader_prototypes
  main.dart - the app that uses the shader via my_shader.dart
shaders/
  my_shader.frag - the source code for the shader fragment program
